#   Software engineering project - Resume filter

### My project is a software that will take soft skills(voice analysis and text analysis) into account along with hard skills(resume, github profile, linkedin profile). It would reduce human effort and would provide better substitutes for the resume filtration process.

I would personally recomend you make a virtual environment, and then run the application inside the environment.

##  Tech stack used:
1. Django Framework 
This is Django framework based project, for folder structure i have used the structure referenced by [python documentation](https://django-project-skeleton.readthedocs.io/en/latest/structure.html)

2. HTML + CSS + JS 
This is used for front end work on the applcation, we could further move on to react js library in the furture.

3. Voice analysis API:
API Provider is [api.assemblyai.com](https://docs.assemblyai.com/overview/getting-started)

4. Text analysis API:
API Provider is [dandelion.eu](https://dandelion.eu/docs/api/datatxt/sent/v1/)

##  How to start the application:
1. Open the resume filter directory
2. Install all the requirements
3. In the terminal type python manage.py runserver
