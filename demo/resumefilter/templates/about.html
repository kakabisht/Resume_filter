        <p class="mt-4 mb-4">This application aims to take soft skills(voice analysis) into account along with hard skills(resume) during the resume filtration process. 
          The ultimate motive is to provide a better experience for our intended audience.
          Our project will only be implemented as a software and will have no extra hardware needed.
